        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h2>Japanese Chicken Curry</h2>
        <span>Origin: Japan</span>
        <span>Source: Family Recipe</span>
        <span>Category: Main Dish</span>

        <img src="images/Japanese Chicken Curry.jpg" width = "400" alt="Japanese Chicken Curry">
        <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. Itâ€™s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Skinless,bonless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
            <li>1 can of peas</li>
            <li>5 potatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 packaged sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <span>Origin: China</span>
        <span>Source: Own recipe</span>
        <span>Category:Chinese Dessert</span>

        <img src="images/mooncake.jpg" width = "400" alt="Snow Skin Mooncakes">
        <p>The Snow SKin Mooncake unlike traditional mooncake, can be made without an oven. It is very easy to make and super delicious.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>Regular rice flour</li>
            <li>Wheat starch</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Condensed milk</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>
            <li>Pre-made custard filling</li>
            <li>Mooncake molds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the skin until well combined. Pour the mixture into a deep plate.</li>
            <li>Cover the plate with mixture with a plate to avoid dripping water. Steam over medium-high heat for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>With a flexible spatula, scrape the hardened dough off the plate. Transfer it to another plate to cool quickly.</li>
            <li>Once no longer hot to touch, combine and knead it with gloved hands until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li> Divide the dough and filling into equal pieces (a kitchen scale helps). Roll each into a ball.</li>
            <li>Flatten a piece of dough into a disc. Place a piece of filling in the middle.</li>
            <li>Gently push the wrapper upwards to tightly cover the entire filling. Seal well on the top.</li>
            <li>Roll the assembled ball in the toasted glutinous rice flour to gain a thin coating.</li>
            <li>Put it into a mooncake mold. Place the mold on a flat, lightly dusted surface. Press the springy handle to shape the mooncake.</li>
            <li>Lift the mold up. Press the handle again to push the mooncake onto the surface.</li>

        </ol>
